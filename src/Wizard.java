//This class is derived from the Character class. A Wizard is a Character that fights by casting spells. Spells inflict damage and require mana to be cast.
//
//The Wizard class will have:
//
//Variable called mana of data type int, random between 10-50, representing a resource the wizard consumes to cast spells (Private member)
//Variable called intelligence of data type int, random between 1-50, measuring how strong the wizard spells are (Private member)
//Public Getter functions to access these variables
//Public Setter functions to change these variables
//A parameterized constructor that takes name, hp, mana, and intelligence
//A public function that overloads attack() implemented in the Attacker interface, that will take a character as a parameter and reduce that characterâ€™s health based on the intelligence of the spell
